USER_REQUEST='i want to take algorithm course this term, which professor you suggest?'

Please create a Cypher query based on USER_REQUEST for a graph in Neo4j where nodes represent Professors. Each Professor node has the following properties: professor_id (which is unique and should be used to identify the professor), first_name, last_name, email, department, teaching, collaboration_start_year, research_interests, and publications_file. The professor_id should be used as the unique identifier for each node, and the query should create nodes for Professors with the given properties. IMPORTANT: When filtering based on the request, the query should not require an exact match for fields like 'teaching' or 'research_interests', but should instead search for partial matches (e.g., using the CONTAINS operator) for the keyword "Computer Vision". Additionally, the results should be sorted by collaboration_start_year in ascending order (i.e., from the smallest number upward). No additional explanations are needed, just the Cypher query.
